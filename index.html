        <h1>Cricket: A Gentleman&rsquo;s Game</h1>

        <h2>What is Cricket?</h2>
        <p>
            Cricket is called a <strong>Gentleman&rsquo;s game</strong> because England was the one who initially played 
            and popularized the game. A traditional bat and ball sport, cricket challenges two teams of 
            eleven players against one another. A rectangular 22-yard pitch is in the middle of a big oval 
            field where the game is played. The goal of the game is to score more runs while batting 
            first and set a target for the opposition team. Where one team bowls and fields and the 
            other team bats. After the first innings is completed, the other team now bats and can 
            chase the score, and they win, or the bowling team can all out the other team while chasing.
            Runs are earned when the batter smashes the ball outside of the boundary line directly, it is 
            given as six runs. If the ball bounces before reaching the boundary line, it is given as four 
            runs or can run to the other end of the pitch. At the same time, bowlers and fielders in opposition 
            teams try to dismiss the batters by hitting the stumps, catching the ball directly without touching 
            the ground or using other techniques.
        </p>

        <h2>What equipments are needed in cricket?</h2>
        <p>
            A willow bat and a hard leather ball, which may be red or white in color, depending on the format of the game. For batsman safety, they wear 
            helmets, gloves, pads, and guards. The wicketkeeper wears gloves and pads for safety, but fielders wear nothing. There are three stumps
            with two bails, known as wickets, at either end of the field.   
        </p>

            <li>One bowler bowls six legal balls in each over.</li>
            <li>When ten men are out or the overs are completed, the batting session is over</li>
            <li>If bowlers bowl the ball outside of the crease, then it is given as wide.</li>
            <li>At the end of the game, the team with more runs wins. </li>
